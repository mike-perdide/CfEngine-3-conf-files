# runagent_control.cf - runagent control promises

# Settings describing the details of the fixed behavioural promises made by
# cf-runagent. The most important parameter here is the list of hosts that the
# agent will poll for connections. This is easily read in from a file list,
# however when doing so always have a stable input source that does not depend
# on the network (including a database or directory service) in any way:
# introducing such dependencies makes configuration brittle.
